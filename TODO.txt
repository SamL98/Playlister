Change recommend next track from searching spotify recommendations to searching \
song with smallest Euclidean distance to the feature vector output by the model.

Think about changing seed size. Either go from 4->9 or somehow expand size over time.\
The latter would require multiple models with different input sizes, I think.

For now, just implement a (desktop?) interface to select 4 songs and output the \
resulting playlist.

Also, maybe get spotify recommendations based off of top 1 or 2 closest library \
tracks to interleave into playlist. Kind of like a Daily Mix to get a nice variation \
of familiar and new tracks.
